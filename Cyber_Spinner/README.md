Final project for Computer Graphics and Design course. 
The course focused on engineering drawings, solidworks design, and creating engineering drawing packets.

For this project, we were to design a toy to be used to teach children basic addition and/or subtraction.
The design focused on allowing kids to create equations that they could solve. For more information, read Report.pdf

The final drawing packet is under Final_Drawing.pdf
