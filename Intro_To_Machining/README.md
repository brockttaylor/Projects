Project Repository for Intro To Machining
The primary project for the course was to make a jack lift which raises or lowers by rotating the bar on the side.
The links, top and bottom blocks, and right and left blocks were machined using a CNC mill based off of Solidworks CAM software output.
The threaded rod and the connecting shaft were machined using a lathe. Holes were threaded using a tap and die set.

The base was unique to each student and to be laser cut.
I chose a circular base with the pattern being generated as a fractal using a Python script I wrote.
